        <h1>Introduction. Thinking and science</h1>
        <p>
            By navigating and performing STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) related activities or any
            other
            science based activity, every student and professional is ment to subscribe somehow under the first letter
            of
            this abreviation, the capital “S”. S stands for science. The basis of science is scientifical way of
            thinking
            and cooperating in the way that promotes scientific thought. Our brain, and cognitive abilities associated
            with
            it, is our main instrument for success or … failure. Our natural way of perceiving world around us and
            thinking
            is very effective for to satisfy our basic needs, when circumstances are like these, we are evolved to deal
            with
            (natural habitat, small groups only). It is not possible for us to be evolutionary adapted to deal with
            modern
            world – advanced technology, complex society, as these changes (like urbanisation and industialisation)
            happened
            during just a few centuries. Our natural way of perceiving world around us and thinking is plagued with
            properties, that are counterproductive, when we are on our way to understand things and processes around us,
            when we live in a world as it is today. The ultimate human problem is having a sense of allways being right,
            of
            allways having true beliefs, despite of countrary evidence [(xx)]. The solution Nr. 1 for almost all global
            problems is to know ourselves beter, to teach how to avoid unnecessery errors, false beliefs, bias (like
            racism,
            xenophobia etc.), waste of resources (like public policies based on pseudoscience), conflicts, man-made
            disasters (think – nuclear weapons). As we see, false beliefs can be very dangerous (330 thousand dead in
            few
            years just in one country due to false beliefs about helth care issues [(Geffen, 2005; Jaiswal, LoSchiavo, &
            Perlman, 2020; Simelela, Venter, Pillay, & Barron, 2015; Tsikata, Pindi, & Anaele, 2016)]). Science as a
            progressive process, and scientific thinking is the way to overcome most issues with our limited and
            fallible
            perception, memory and thinking. Our effort could be especially valuable, as it is shown, that often even
            universities fail to provide adequat opportunities to learn to think critically and scientifically
            [(Pavlovskis,
            2021)]. Acquisition of critical, scientific thinking and its regular use does not result in contempt for
            human
            emotions and values based on them, as some wrongly assume. As pressing global issues arise, clear, unbiased
            thinking is the way for sustainability and preservation of cultural and natural heritage.
