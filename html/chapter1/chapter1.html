        <h1>Chapter 1. Perceptual illusions and naïve realism</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Naïve realism</b> is our tendency to trust our senses, our perceptions, memories and thoughts too much. Erroneously we regard our own experience as more trustful and valuable source of information than any other (e.g. findings of scientific research meta-analysis). There is a lot of evidence that we, all of us, humans, are much more fallible than we think. We all have a lot of false believs, but despite that fact, we are allways tended to think, that we don’t hold any single believe that is false, and that is not justified. We seek, and we are responsive almost only to the information, that confirms our existing beliefs. This is confirmation bias. We are able to ignore massive amount of evidence against our cherished beliefs. This is number one reason, why we need science as a very special fact finding process, that greatly differs from natural thinking of an individual. In chapter 3 You will find example of what difference this makes.

        <p>
            We will start with some simple visual experiments and illusions, and then will proceed to thinking irregularities common to all of us. Aim of these activities is not to discourage You making your own observations and conclusions, but to equip You with some necessery knowledge of how extensive problem naïve realism is, and how to overcome problems associated with it. And don’t be fooled in to any form of anti-realism either. For to stay on reasonable discourse, we still have to acknowledge (or at least assume), that we have some indirect, limited and imperfect access to objective reality out there, that is common to all of us.
