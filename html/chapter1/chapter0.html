            <b>Naïve realism</b> is our tendency to trust our senses, our perceptions, memories and thoughts too
much. Erroneously we regard our own experience as a more trustful and valuable source of
information than any other (e.g. findings of scientific research meta-analysis). There is a lot of
evidence that we, all of us, humans, are much more fallible than we think. We all have a lot of false
beliefs, but despite that fact, we always tend to think that we don’t hold any single believe that is
false, and that is not justified. We seek, and we are responsive almost only to the information, that
confirms our existing beliefs. This is confirmation bias. We are able to ignore massive amount of
evidence against our cherished beliefs. This is the number one reason why we need science as a
very special fact finding process, that greatly differs from the natural thinking of an individual. In
chapter 3 You will find an example of what difference this makes.

            We will start with some simple visual experiments and illusions, and then will proceed to
thinking irregularities common to all of us. Aim of these activities is not to discourage You making
your own observations and conclusions, but to equip You with some necessary knowledge of how
extensive problem naïve realism is, and how to overcome problems associated with it. And don’t be
fooled into any form of anti-realism either. For to stay on reasonable discourse, we still have to
acknowledge (or at least assume) that we have some indirect, limited and imperfect access to
objective reality out there, that is common to all of us.
