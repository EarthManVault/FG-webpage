    <p>What kind of logic do we really apply, when we think that we think in a logical manner? Even when we are trying hard to draw some logical conclusions, is this realy a logic?</p>

  <p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-radius:5px; border-color:#2196F3; padding: 1em;">Matt has an office in the city. He has loved animals since he was a kid. He does his work on alive species. He sometimes needs to work in emergency situations.
    Arrange the following statements in order according to how likely they are (1.: most likely, … , 4.: least likely).

Good news: This is normal. At least 85% of people...
<br> <br>
OK, than You may ask, why say 15% of people do this task right? This could be done by chance, by
using proper logic, and by using wrong logic plus chance. First of all, there are 24 ways to arrange 4
answers, 8 of them are correct answers (every answer where option “C” is ranked lower than “A”
and “D”). So we have a 33% probability to have a right answer by chance. It does mean exactly that
– we humans generaly are worse performers on some mental tasks than a dice, or coin flip model.
And what is proper logic for this task anyway?

<div style="padding: 1em; display: none" id="wrongBadNews"> 
<p>
Bad news: You are wrong! This could not be logical, as there is no way that a probability to satisfy
two conditions at a time (Matt is a vet and an athlete) could be greater than for one separate
condition (a vet or an athlete).
